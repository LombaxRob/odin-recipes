# odin-recipes
# HTML creation
1st Project of Odin Project Foundation
Using HTML code to build a recipes website

Finished project quickly as HTML came back
to me quickly having done it at Uni. Main
improvement going forward is to commit as
I go along and not just all at the end.

Also then realised I wrote the commit message
slightly wrong, should have said update not 
updated.

# CSS addition
Going back to this project and adding style
making use of CSS.

Able to implement CSS and remembered basics
from university and have got better at using
git and github.

Will need to come back and refine the use of
the cascade and box models, with lists being
the most obvious fix.
