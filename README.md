# odin-recipes
# HTML creation
1st Project of Odin Project Foundation
Using HTML code to build a recipes website

Finished project quickly as HTML came back
to me quickly having done it at Uni. Main
improvement going forward is to commit as
I go along and not just all at the end.

Also then realised I wrote the commit message
slightly wrong, should have said update not 
updated.
