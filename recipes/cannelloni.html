    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cannelloni noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>5 shallots, chopped</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small eggplant, diced</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 roasted red bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook cannelloni in boiling water until partially cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. (They will finish cooking when baked.) Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir 1/3 of the shallots and 1/2 of the garlic in hot oil for 30 seconds. Pour in sherry, increase heat to high, and reduce liquid by half. Stir in cream and reduce until about 1 1/2 cups liquid remains. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Set cream sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, remaining shallots, and remaining garlic in hot oil until vegetables are tender. Transfer to a large bowl. Add roasted red peppers, Parmesan, ricotta, oregano, and basil; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Stuff vegetable-cheese filling into cannelloni and place in the prepared baking dish. Cover with cream sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and heated through, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
